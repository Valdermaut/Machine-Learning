# ML(Basics of matplotlib, pandas, numpy)

In this. repository, I have done basics of matplotlib,pandas and numpy on colab Notebook
matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.
Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, 
creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

If you provide a single list or array to the plot() command, matplotlib assumes it is a sequence of y values, and 
automatically generates the x values for you. Since python ranges start with 0,
the default x vector has the same length as y but starts with 0. Hence the x data are [0,1,2,3].
 
 In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation 
 and analysis
